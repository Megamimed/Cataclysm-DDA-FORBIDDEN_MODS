So I really don't care if a gun would reasonably found in new England or not I just want to horde weapons, so if somethings not allowed on main branch and is a real weapon Include it here.


As of right now this mod includes the following

Guns:
- FAMAS* (Currently uses Stanag magazines rather than a proprietary one) 
- FN2000*
- HH9 pistol - Don't care if they went bankrupt, Looks cool af. Would like it to have a chance of being outright broken though since a lot of them shipped busted.
- zip .22 - Mostly because it's funny bad. Would like to make it shoot you in the hand occasionally.
- Automag III - Added by Holli-Git
- SKS M - Added by Holli-Git
- Russian 1895 Winchester - Added by Holli-Git

Professions:
- Armed and Dangerous - Essentailly the default survivor setting but with a ZiP and two loaded magazines (a 10rnd and 32rnd)


I want to include:
- LA85 - Gimme that dogshit bullpup
- L1A1 - and any other FAL variant I guess?
- Dardick and all the trounds https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardick_tround


Not sure if it's already in? include if not:
- Mk22 - if possible toggle the slide lock feature?
- PSG1 - Metal gear


This is my first mod and I frankly don't know how half the gun stats work and I'm English (Never fired a gun) so if you want to make balance or realism changes (not including removing a weapon outright) go nuts.
I'm keeping each weapon as it's own JSON for my sanity and would prefer any additions to follow that for ease of customising your gun list but if that's a faux pas let me know.
