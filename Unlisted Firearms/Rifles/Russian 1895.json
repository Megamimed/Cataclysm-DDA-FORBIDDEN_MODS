    "description": "The Winchester 1895 was a revolutionary lever action rifle by none other than John Browning.  It was able to fire spitzer bullets unlike most lever actions due to its box magazine.  After rejection from the US Army, a contract to make them in 7.62x54mmR was in order.  While Russia soon after became the USSR (Not because of the firearm), a few did make their way into Russian inventory.  This is likely not one of those.  Feeds from mosin stripper clips.",
