Adds Cosmetics such as lipstick, facepaint and eyeliner as items that can be applied to your character as 'mutations'.

Works similar to hair in that the makeup is added as a trait.

Currently there is art for the Chibi and MSX+ tilesets. I will get around to doing some for ultica eventually.

Aside from "eyeblack" which is intended to reduce glare from the sun, the makeup is entirely cosmetic.

I'd say it's currently at the proof of concept stage. I still need to fine tune the item_groups and wear and tear, once all that is sorted adding in new styles should be as easy enough.
